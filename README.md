### About Picaflic 

> Picaflic all started when one man asked the age old question: how is one to keep track of hundreds (likely thousands) of their favourite movies? He soon found out he wasn't the only one asking. You've probably asked yourself this same question a lot. We wanted to finally give you an answer.

> Picaflic wanted to break the mold when it comes to searching for and saving the movies you really, really, really, really love. Finally you and your loved ones can search, find, and save, all in one place. Here's what some people might have said about it. It's impossible to know if they haven't.

#### "Picaflic literally saved my life"
 - Quentin Tarantino, famous man
#### "Truly, I think, as brave as when we got rid of the headphone jack."
 - Tim Cook, famous business person
#### "I mean no, it's not one of the reasons I decided to start making movies. It's the only reason."
 - JRR Tolkein, owner of four initials

> So without further ado, let's get you started on the same platform that probably literally saved a life, bravely, and also inspired someone.
